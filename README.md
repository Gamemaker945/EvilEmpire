# EvilEmpire
Welcome! I hope you enjoy this minigame. My goal was to make something that shows 
a snippet of what I can do. I did what I can with the time I have available
and didn't want to spend too much time and have you all wait too long.

When coming up with the idea, I wanted to do something no one else was likely
doing. So I came up with this. I played on the "Evil Empire" theme and went with
a space motif. Gameplay is simple: a hull breach in a portal viewing window has occured. 
Drag the letters into the holes to plug the breach. You have 60 seconds before 
the oxygen levels reach a critical level. Have fun!

A few notes about the project:
1. Art is not optimized and is overbloated. I am not an artist by any means. Proper
   art would shave memory usage by a ton.

2. UIKit is not an optimal SDK for this. SpriteKit would be better but again I 
   felt time was important and I didn't want to take too much time honing my
   spritekit knowledge when UIKit would get the point across. Likewise Unity3D
   would have done even better and allowed for cooler effects. I am still learning
   this toolset so I stuck with what I know.

3. Excuse the art.  :)  I made what I can. My artistic skills are limited.

4. Even if not chosen, I would love to hear your comments. I am always learning
   and always value feedback.
